# Dicey_roads
Game in unity for GMTK game jam

The rules are simple:
* You play as the dice.
* W, A, S and D are used move around.
* Q and E are used to change perspective of the dice.
* You can climb onto blocks but not if they are stacked.
* The dice moves a number of spaces indicated by the number on top of the dice after moving.
* If you fall you reset to your original location but the number you fell with remains.
* The yellow tiles fall after a certain time if you stay on them or immediately if you move over them.
* The purple tiles indicate the end of the level.
